# Sherezade Maqueda Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project is a showcase of the skills and projects I've developed as a self-taught web developer, with a particular emphasis on front-end development. Through this portfolio, I aim to take you on a journey from my roots in media and gastronomy, through my exploration of UX design, and finally to my passion for web development. It also reflects my commitment to collaboration and continuous professional growth in the tech industry.

## üåü Key Features

- **Animated Hero Section**: A dynamic introduction with animated elements that immediately engage the visitor.
- **Interactive 3D Earth Model**: Created using `three.js`, this Earth model adds an interactive and visually compelling element to the site.
- **Animated Section Elements**: Leveraging `framer motion`, various elements are animated as they appear on the screen, enhancing the user experience.
- **Tilt Animations**: Applied to cards in the Expertise and Work sections, the tilt effect adds a dynamic and modern touch to the presentation.
- **Timeline**: A detailed timeline in the About section that chronicles my personal, professional, and educational journey.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React**: The primary JavaScript library used to build the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling, providing a utility-first CSS framework.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations, adding smooth transitions and visual appeal.
- **Three.js**: Used to create the 3D Earth model and other 3D elements.
- **EmailJS**: For handling the contact form and sending emails directly from the portfolio.
